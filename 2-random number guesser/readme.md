This mini project is a random number guessing game. Upon loading the page, a random number between 1 and 100 is generated. After entering a guessed number into the input field, a response is given indicating whether to guess a higher number, a lower number, or a congratulatory message for guessing the correct number! Upon guessing the correct number, a modal is displayed showing how many attempts it took to guess the number correctly and the number itself. For testing convenience, upon loading the page, the correct randomly generated number is displayed in the console.

This project involves the use of HTML, CSS (including responsive design), and Vanilla JavaScript.
